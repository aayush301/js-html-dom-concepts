Event Propagation: Event Capturing and Event Bubbling

When an event (e.g., click) occurs in an element, and the element along with some of its parents have also registered for that event, then
1. Event capturing means: First its parent executes its event handler and then the element (Propagation from outer to inner).
2. Event Bubbling means:  First the element executes its event handler and then its parent (Propagation from inner to outer).

Now, the accepted model by W3C is:
First event capturing occurs followed by event bubbling.
This means that first the event is captured by the element's parents until it reaches the target (element) and then bubbles up again.
We, as web developer can choose whether to register an event handler in the capturing phase or bubbling phase:
  element.addEventListener("click", ()=> {...}, {capture: true})  // default is capture:false


In general:
When we click somewhere on screen,
First, capturing phase occurs where,
    Those onclick event listeners on the most farthest ancestor will be called which have capture:true.
    This continues till the most closest ancestor.
Then, bubbling phase occurs where,
    Those onclick event listeners on the most closest ancestor will be called which have capture:false.
    This continues till the most farthest ancestor.

By default, capture is false, so, only bubbling occurs by default.
